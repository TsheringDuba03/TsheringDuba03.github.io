      <h2>Brief</h2>
      <p>(Brief Provided by General Assembly UXDi NYC) Patelco has not upgraded their website in quite some time. They do not want to be stuck with their current limitations upon upgrading their system in two years. Also, they are seeking a fresh approach to help customers manage their money.

      <p>From our research, we found most users had a neutral reaction to online banking. But those who used Simple or USAA, happily & positively described their banking experience. This directed us to look at these apps & tease out what they had that other banking apps lacked. What we found is that most apps had a neutral, cold tone to them; Simple & USAA both had an approachable, clear, guiding voice to their copy and features. This gave the user a sense of control over how they interacted with their bank. (See below for a specific example.)

         Simple's “Safe-to-Spend” function alligns goals with a customers account balance. This gives an accurate depiction of the money a customer has not allocated that month. Therefore, a user worries less about over-spending.

      <h2> Ideation </h2>
      <p>We used a rapid ideation process to sketch possible features out by hand. This focused our scope by visualizing how certain features were more conducive to our time constraints, business objectives, and user requirements. We could try to build a robust tool in a short amount of time, but that would only spread us thin in terms of paying attention to user feedback. At this junction our team felt that our time was best spent fleshing out a long-term goal tracking feature.

          </div>
          
      <h2> Personas & User Journeys </h2>
      <p>With the goal feature in mind, we needed to understand how users could approach this feature. How would they interact differently on a desktop compared to a mobile device? We developed and used a primary persona: Jake, and two secondary personas as tools for this process. A main takeaway from this was the minimum required pages we would need for our first prototype.  </p>

      <h2>Wireframe & Testing</h2>
      <p>After white boarding and trashing a ton of approaches, we moved on to making low fidelity wireframes. I began using the first iteration to test out on some users right away. This gave us a quick turn around for issues that stood out. The biggest eyesores we removed were: making copy we had used less ambiguous, making certain actions more obvious, and reframing functions that were confusing. </p>

            <figcaption>
              We tried using "Desire" to convey how users would add a personal expression to their work through photos or notes. It was confusing and overlooked by users - so we cut it.

              We used a slider to allow editing the amount of a goal. This element was not being observed by users during testing, so we changed the slider color to make it stand out better.

            <figcaption>
              Stating the goal achievement in terms of percentages was an overlooked flaw. This was difficult as a feature because required the user to remember specifics we could just as easily show them.

      <h2>High Fedelity Prototype</h2>
      <p> Once we finished our third round of user tests, I moved on to skinning the prototype to give it a clean visual user interface. I made my choices for color pallet, flat buttons, and visual icons based on Patelco’s current branding styles. I belived that keeping this style when working for a client is highly important: my job in redesign is not to rebrand my client, only to better communicate their website for their users to understand. </p>

      <h2>Deliverable Design </h2>
      <p>Our finished design was well accepted by our client. They felt that we had stuck to the branding of the site, while having provided a clean product that met their business needs and kept the user at the center of the design process. One overall takeaway for me from this project was learning to work and communicate with team members and our project managers under time strenuous circumstances. </p>
